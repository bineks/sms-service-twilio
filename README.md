# SMS service for Twillio (system name: sms-service-twilio)
The plugin is a custom developed solution for checking the WooCommerce order infromation and detecting whether an order has Privacy Policy agreement checkbox selected and if the client has provided Income and Bank statemens. If the data is lacking - an SMS is sent via Twillio to the client's phone with a suggestion to fill in the necessary data.
